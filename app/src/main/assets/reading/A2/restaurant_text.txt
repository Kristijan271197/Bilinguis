Every week my family goes to a restaurant. Restaurants are full of people and there you can order whatever you want. Usually I order soup for the first dish, meat or fish for the second and ice-cream for the dessert.  My mother usually orders a salad and a cream brulee. Sara usually orders some pasta, salad and ice-cream. My father usually orders some soup, fish and a piece of cake. My parents usually drink wine while eating. My mother likes white wine and my father likes red. Sara doesn’t drink alcohol, so she usually orders a lemonade, and after that a cup of hot chocolate. I usually order coke. 

My father said that next time we will go to an Italian restaurant. We will eat only Italian food. Me and Sara love pizza. Sara will probably order some Italian cocktails, too. As for me, I think I will order some Italian cake and milkshake. My mother will probably order some pasta and of course she will have an Italian tiramisu. She’ll have a liqueur, too. My father will have a pizza. He loves pizza, too. My mother never cooks pizza home. She says it is unhealthy. That is why my father come up with an idea for us to go to the restaurant every week.
