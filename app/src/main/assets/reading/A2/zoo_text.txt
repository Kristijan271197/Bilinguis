Yesterday morning, me and my sister watched a TV show about animals. After the show we decided to go to the Zoo. The Zoo was big and full of people.  The first animal we noticed was a zebra. The zebra looked like a horse, but it was black and white. My sister noticed two giraffes. Giraffes are tall and have long necks. My sister Sara thinks that giraffes are beautiful. They are her favorite animals.
 
I don’t have a favorite animal. I like them all. The elephants are big and cute. I like the way they drink water. Tigers and lions are beautiful, but dangerous animals. There were baby tigers at the zoo. They were so small and cute. Sara doesn’t like them, because they look like a cat and she likes dogs.

We walked for two hours and finally we noticed the pandas. The look like a bear, but they are black and white. They have black circles around their eyes. Sara looked for the monkeys on the 1st floor, but they were on the 2nd. Monkeys are funny and smart animals. Sometimes they act like humans. They sometimes eat like us, drink like us and even walk like us.

At home my mother asked us did we like the zoo and then we talked about animals. My parents love animals. My mother worked as a vet ten years ago.
