This is my room. Let me show you my closet. I have a lot of clothes. This is my favorite dress. It is black and white. Here are my favorite shoes. Every Sunday I put my favorite drees and my favorite shoes and I go on a walk in the park with my friends.

Let me show you my shorts and my favorite t-shirt. They are a gift from my mother for my 15th birthday. This is my favorite blue shirt. It’s a gift from Sara. I like summer clothes. They light and comfortable. I usually wear dresses, shorts and t-shirts in the summer. Sometimes I go swimming and I wear my green swimming suit and my yellow hat.

In the winter I usually wear jeans, jumpers and my black jacket. When I go outside, I put on my gloves, hat and scarf. It is cold outside even when it is not snowing. I don’t like winter, because my mother doesn’t let me wear a dress. She always worries that I could get sick. She even makes me wear extra pair of socks. I never go outside without a hat.

In the spring I usually wear lighter clothes. When I go on a walk, I always wear a coat and a scarf. Sometimes I even put my favorite dress on. I always have an umbrella with me.

It is sunny today, so I am wearing a red dress and black shoes. I don’t need a coat, because it is hot outside.
