My family lives in a small town. We have a beach and a park near our house. I like living in a small town, because everybody is friendly.

There are a lot of streets in our town. There are 4 banks, 6 schools and 3 hospitals in our town. They all are in the city center. We have 3 parks and a big beach, too. In summer everybody likes spending some time on the beach. 

Near the beach there are 4 small restaurants and 6 small coffees shops. Every weekend I go there after my walk in the park. My friend Kira loves one of the coffees shops. We usually drink hot chocolate there or some milkshakes. 

Not far from the center there is a university and a big library. Sara studies there. She likes spending time in the library. Near the university there is a big Italian restaurant. My father loves eating there. 

There is a big hotel next to the restaurant. There is a big city mall on the 9th street. There we buy our clothes.
