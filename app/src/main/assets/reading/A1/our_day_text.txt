Every day I get up at 8 and I have a breakfast with my parents and sister. I usually go to school at 9 o’clock. I spend half of my day at school. My classes always finish at 3 o’clock and I am home by 4 o’clock. Usually we have a lunch at 4.30. After my lunch I always go for a walk in the park. There I can relax after my school day. Usually after lunch, my father spends some time in the garden with my mother. Sometimes my mother reads there and my sister swims in our pool. Usually we spend some time after lunch outside. 

Today is a rainy day. No walks for me. No garden for my parents and no pool for my sister. It is cold outside and that is why everybody is at home. My father is watching the News while my mother is reading her new book. She reads a new book every week. My sister is playing the piano in her room. I am siting on armchair and watching it rain.
