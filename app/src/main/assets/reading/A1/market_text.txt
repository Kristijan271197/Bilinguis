Every Sunday we go to the market. We usually buy some oranges, bananas, fresh milk, juice, cheese, onion, garlic, potatoes, tomatoes and carrots. My mother doesn't work, so she cooks every day.

Tomorrow is my father’s birthday. Every year I go to the market and buy some fruit and my mother makes a strawberry cake. It is my father’s favorite cake. The market is not far from home. Today I need to buy a lot of strawberries, some milk, flour, sugar and ice-cream.
