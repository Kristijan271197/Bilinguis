Every Sunday we go to the market. We usually buy some oranges, bananas, fresh milk, juice, cheese, onion, garlic, potatoes, tomatoes and carrots. My mother doesn't work, so she cooks every day.

Tomorrow is my father’s birthday. Every year I go to the market and buy some fruit and my mother makes a strawberry cake. It is my father’s favorite cake. The market is not far from home. Today I need to buy a lot of strawberries, some milk, flour, sugar and ice-cream. 

- Hello! Do you have any fresh strawberries?
- Yes, we do! How much do you need?
- 2 kilos!
- That’s 8 dollars.
- Thank you!
- Would you like to buy some milk and flour? Everything is fresh!
- Yes, please! And do you have any sugar?
- Yes, I do! How much do you need?
- Not much! 1 kilo.
- That’s 1.5 dollars for the milk, 1 dollar for the flour and 1 dollar for the sugar.
- Thank you!
