Meet my family. This is my mother Mira, my father Victor and my sister Sara.  My mother doesn’t work. She is always home. She cooks every day. In her free time, she reads or watches TV. My father is a doctor. He works every day. In his free time, he is home with us. My sister is a student. She studies every day. My name is Kim and I am a student, too. I go to school every day. 

Every weekend we spend time together. We eat together, we watch TV together, we go to the market and buy things together. 

This is our house. We have so many rooms. This is our living room. Here we spend our time together. On weekend we sit on the sofa and watch movies all evening. This is our dining room. Here we eat our breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is our kitchen. Here my mother spends most of her time. This is my mother’s and my father’s bedroom, and this is our bathroom. This is my sister’s room, and this is my room. I love my room. Here I usually study, listen to music, watch tv shows or read books.
